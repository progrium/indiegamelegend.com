          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            Independent game developers have gone missing and your only lead on
            their whereabouts is a distress signal from a remote alien base.
            It's up to you to infiltrate this hostile labyrinth and uncover the
            answers you need to rescue them. Explore five diverse biomes while
            surviving dangerous hazards and obstacles, solving clever puzzles,
            and taking down ruthless and relentless enemies. The lives of these
            indies, and the future of independent games, depends on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Immerse yourself in this nostalgic, colorful, and quirky handcrafted
            FPS as you uncover the secrets and lore of a retro world that blurs
            the line between game and reality. In the process, enter the storied
            and autobiographical psyche of an independent game developer facing
            their inner demons while battling the challenges of making games for
            the love of the medium.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspired by the NES cult hit The Guardian Legend and other classic
            titles, The Indie Game Legend 3D provides a fresh lens to what a
            classic 8-bit game might look like through the eyes of the player
            character.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your mission, critical to the future of indie games, will become The
            Indie Game Legend.
          </p>

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            In 2011, Paul Hubans an active figure on TIGSource, released a
            freeware game as Phubansoft on the TIGSource forums, called The
            Indie Game Legend. The Indie Game Legend was inspired by a desire to
            make a bite-sized, easily digestible game that provided an outlet
            for his insecurities and struggles with jealousy and success as a
            game developer. As the game progressed, it became a way to connect
            with friends on the forum including a myriad of notable game
            development figures and inside jokes among friends. The game was
            well received but shortly thereafter fell into obscurity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Six years later, Jeff Lindsay, a friend of Paul’s, began
            experimenting with assets from The Indie Game Legend to see what it
            would be like from a first-person perspective. Paul was excited by
            this new take on the game, and the two decided to team up to
            collaborate on a larger-scale release.
          </p>

            Joined by Stevie Hryciw, who did the original music, they worked to
            double the number of diverse areas in the game, and shifted the
            gameplay to first-person, which allowed for a feeling of being
            literally immersed into a retro gameplay experience dreamed of from
            their childhood.

            Wanting to keep the game light-hearted and quirky, they evolved the
            narrative of the game to serve as a love letter to the indie game
            dev community, but also touch on Paul's challenges and experiences
            as a young indie game developer.

          <h2>About Progrium Games</h2>
          <p>
            Jeff Lindsay was a hobbyist game developer from an early age. After
            high school he started running TIGSource with Derek Yu and put up
            what is now the largest online forum for the indie game scene.
            Professionally, he made an impact in the web and systems software
            fields, working at NASA and Twilio, and independently helped bring
            Docker, webhooks, and a number of other influential tools into the
            world. Other than occasional prototypes, Jeff became fairly inactive
            in games.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a decade working in tech, Jeff came back to indie games. His
            first freeware release was Visitor Center in 2017, a love letter to
            the 1993 SNES Jurassic Park game. Looking for a bigger challenge
            next, he took on The Indie Game Legend 3D in collaboration with Paul
            Hubans as his first commercial game project.

          <h2>About Phubansoft</h2>
          <p>
            For most of his life, Paul Hubans has been designing games. He
            started with NES-inspired drawings of his game ideas in the late
            80s. By highschool he was hacking NES ROMs using tile editing tools
            and HEX editors. In the early 2000s, Paul started making his own
            fully playable games in Game Maker. The most notable of these was
            his horror top-down multiplayer shooter, MADHOUSE.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the mid 2000s, Paul worked for SEGA of America doing QA on titles
            like Full Auto and Shadow the Hedgehog. He went on to work at 2D Boy
            as a production associate on their indie smash hit, World of Goo.
            Paul's experience with 8-bit pixel art that dated back to highschool
            landed him a job as background artist on Capcom's 2011 DSI title,
            Dark Void Zero. 2011 was also the year that Paul made and released
            the original 2D version of The Indie Game Legend. Two years later he
            released Spunk &amp; Moxie, a one-button masocore platformer on
            mobile. Today, he is working on Mossmouth's UFO 50 project and The
            Indie Game Legend 3D.
